- ignore non-English AVI scene releases that don't contain subtitle
- add timeout when waiting till the download to finish
	- announcement rescheduling while torrent is not visible on GFT (needed only when we will support more than one sources?)
- PtpUploaderInvalidLoginException should just disable the source (if it is ptp it can quit)
- check pending downloads too when checking for dupes
- support of relogging, timeouts and retrying in all HTTP requests
- per source filtering settings
- limit ratio (and seeding time) on source
- replace pyWHATauto or at least make it capable of rejoining
- check available space before downloading 
- automatically switching to an alternative host if ptpimg is down
- replace file based communication between irc bot and the uploader (or keep it and add an alternative)
- store Settings.ini elsewhere

----
- GFT: use pretime from IRC announcements to differentiate scene releases
- CG: how do we let the user pick a release name?
	-  instead of international title make a force release name boolean checkbox? 
- add size checking: allow an ~1400 MB xvid if only a ~700 MB version exists
- source: cinematik support
- source: finish directory/file support
- wizard interface for upload page: http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tabs/wizard.html
- better layout for jobs page. Eg.: http://community.nuxeo.com/
- add separate options for each settings that the force mode currently overrides
	- so it would be possible to resume a torrent with multiple NFOs in it with a new setting
- force instant start regardless of maximum simultaneous downloads. What about (manual) torrent source?
- torrent file uploads: delete torrents from the temporary directory 
- torrent file uploads: Firefox doesn't restrict the file selector to torrents files. Works in Chrome.
	- jquery-html5-upload was used only because it doesn't create form. Any alternative that works inside a form?

- torrent site uploads: delete torrent file from release directory
- optimization: torrent site uploads should contact the source site only when there is a missing info
	- for example when resuming a torrent, there is a useless page load 
- optimization: is expire_on_commit needed?
	- during a work on a job, there are a lot of commits, that cause full reloads from the server
- upload UI: support for user specified screens
