# Per source site settings that only apply to automatically created jobs:
#	- AutomaticJobStartDelay
#		- Number of seconds to wait before starting to process the job.
#
#	- StopAutomaticJob
#		- If this is set then the job will be stopped at the specified phase.
#		- Possible values for the setting:
#			- BeforeDownloadingTorrentFile
#				- Job is stopped before downloading the torrent file from the source site.
#			- BeforeExtracting
#				- Job is stopped after the downloading has finished and before extracting (making the upload directory) the release.
#
#	- StopAutomaticJobIfThereAreMultipleVideos
#		- If this is set and the release contains multiple non-ignored video files then the job will be stopped.
#		- Unneeded files can be added to the ignore ignore list on the WebUI.
#		- Possible values for the setting:
#			- BeforeDownloading
#				- Job is stopped after downloading the torrent file but before starting the downloading of the torrent itself.
#			- BeforeExtracting
#				- Job is stopped after the downloading has finished and before extracting (making the upload directory) the release.
#
# Per source site settings for cooperating on automatically created jobs:
#	- AutomaticJobCooperationMemberCount
#		- Number of the members cooperating on the source. Must be at least two to make sense.
#	- AutomaticJobCooperationMemberId
#		- Member index. Starts from 0 and must be less than the number of the members. It must be different for each user to work as expected.
#	- AutomaticJobCooperationDelay
#		- Number of seconds to wait before starting to process the job if the job belongs to someone else. (See the example below how it exactly works.)
#		- An initial delay for all users can be added by using the AutomaticJobStartDelay.
#
#	Example setup for three users cooperating on a source with 20 minutes delay.
#		AutomaticJobCooperationMemberCount = 3
#		AutomaticJobCooperationDelay = 1200
#		# The following line is different for all users: 0 for the first user, 1 for user second user, 2 for the third user
#		AutomaticJobCooperationMemberId = 0
#
#		Delaying is done justly. (ID is calculated from the release name.):
#			- If ID = 0 then user #1:  0m delay, user #2: 30m delay, user #3: 60m delay.
#			- If ID = 1 then user #1: 60m delay, user #2:  0m delay, user #3: 30m delay.
#			- If ID = 2 then user #1: 30m delay, user #2: 60m delay, user #3:  0m delay.
