PtpUploader v0.1 by TnS

The program does three things: watches for release announcements, downloads them and uploads them to PTP.

This is my first Python program ever, so sorry for the C-ish code and for the semicolons. :)

How it works:
	1. Announcement watching
		- it uses a wrapper for pyWHATauto to watch release announcements on IRC
		- checks release name and filters out the unwanted releases
			- manual announcements are not checked
		- gets IMDb id from NFO
			- NFO is read from the source site
			- in case of manual downloads, NFO is read from the downloaded release
		- release type is figured out from release name (DVD rip, X264, ...)
		- checks if the release exists on PTP
			- manual announcements are not checked
			- uses IMDb id and release type to check against the existing releases on PTP
	2. Downloading
		- in case of manual downloads it does nothing
		- downloads the torrent file from the source
		- torrent file is added to rTorrent and the bot waits till it finishes
	3. Uploading
		- the releases is extracted (including the subtitles) to a separate directory
		- makes media info for all videos
		- takes screenshots from the first (sorted by name) video and uploads to an image hoster (ptpimg or imgur)
		- makes the torrent
		- checks (again) if the release exists on PTP
		- if there is no movie page for this movie on PTP, it uses PTP's IMDb info getter to fill out the required details
			- rehosts the poster if it presents
		- adds the torrent to rTorrent without hash checking
		- fills out PTP's upload or add format form
		- refreshes the movie page (needed to refresh the IMDb info)
