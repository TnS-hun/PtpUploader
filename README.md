With the PtpUploader's WebUI you can upload to PTP by specifying a torrent file and an IMDb or PTP link.
There is also an automatic mode built-in that can check announcements from IRC or RSS and upload everything automatically.

Supported sites for automatic mode:
* Cinemageddon (RSS)
* Cinematik (RSS)
* GFT (IRC, RSS)
* HDBits (RSS)

SceneAccess support was removed on the 9th of July 2013 because of staff pressure...

There is a helper [Greasemonkey script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TnS-hun/PtpUploader/master/PtpUploaderTorrentSender.js) available at to send torrents from a wide variety of sites directly to PtpUploader.

#### Command line only usage

PtpUploader can create release description (with media info and screenshots) for manual uploading from command line.
Syntax:
* `ReleaseInfoMaker.py <target directory or filename>` creates the release description and starts seeding the torrent.
* `ReleaseInfoMaker.py --notorrent <target directory or filename>` creates the release description.
		
Use the resulting torrent that starts with PTP for uploading to the tracker.
